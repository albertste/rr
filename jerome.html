			<h2>Bio</h2>

			<p>This is Jerome. He's from France and has lived in the US, Portugal, and Dubai. He started out working in the technology industry in California where he built and sold several companies. Today he heads his family-run investment firm that invests in markets, startups, and real estate. He spends most of his time working, seeing friends, and staying in shape.</p>

			<h2>Q&A</h2>

			<p><strong>Hey Jerome. Thanks for being on R&R. Why did you join?</strong></p>

			<p>When my friend Kayla [the matchmaker] asked me to join after my previous relationship ended, I brushed her off at first. I had heard of all the success she was having with R&R but didn't really think it was for me – I never used dating apps or met people online. But I gave it a second thought. I wouldn't need to deal with the time consuming aspects of meeting someone new. And it might be an opportunity to meet someone from outside my usual social circles. So I gave it a shot. I guess we'll see how it goes!</p>

			<p><strong>What does a typical day for you look like?</strong></p>
				
			<p>I usually dedicate my mornings to work and my afternoons to sports, friends, and family. I have the good fortune of being able to set my schedule, so I travel from time to time for both work and leisure. My home bases are Lisbon, Paris, and Dubai – those are the cities I always return to.</p>

			<p><strong>What are your hobbies?</strong></p>

			<p>I play padel, basketball, tennis. I do some weightlifting.</p>

			<p>I also read a lot. A big part of my job is to keep on top of how the world really works so I can continue to make successful investments.</p>

			<p><strong>Why did you select these photos?</strong></p>

			<p>They're hardly professional! But I think they represent best how I look in person.</p>

			<p><strong>What are you looking for in terms of physique and personality?</strong></p>
				
			<p>Chemistry. It's hard to define beforehand because it just happens. Physique is important in that it reflects her discipline and that she takes care of herself. Nobody wants to date a slob. But outer beauty inevitably fades away. Qualities like open-mindedness and authenticity matter too.</p>

			<p><strong>What would you do together if we find you a match?</strong></p>

			<p>After a period of getting to know each other, we'd travel together for a while. If our relationship comes out stronger, that's probably a good sign.</p>

			<p><strong>What age range are you looking for?</strong></p>

			<p>Younger than me, since I value open-mindedness and younger people are usually more so. There are many exceptions though, so I'm flexible.</p>

			<p><strong>What's the hallmark of a good relationship?</strong></p>

			<p>Caring, laughing, communicating.</p>

			<p><strong>How do you approach problems in a relationship?</strong></p>

			<p>Just sit down and talk things over. And get a good understanding of what you're doing and where you're going. It's natural for a relationship to have its ups and downs. In my experience, open communication is the most important way to deal with potential problems. Issues that are kept under wraps eventually bubble up and explode. Strong hugs also go a long way in putting problems in perspective.</p>

			<p><strong>What are some items on your bucket list?</strong></p>

			<p>I don't really keep a bucket list. I have personal, career, and family goals that I strive for every day.</p>

			<p><strong>What is trust, in your opinion?</strong></p>

			<p>Trusting someone is about feeling safe with them enough to open up and share things you might not share with anyone else.</p>

			<p><strong>What are your favorite topics for in-depth conversation?</strong></p>

			<p>I like keeping conversations light and fun, but there's nothing wrong with going deep every once in a while. Topics include how the world works, current events, psychology, relationships.</p>

			<p><strong>What's a snack that you like?</strong></p>

			<p>100% dark chocolate.</p>

			<p><strong>Three words your friends would use to describe you?</strong></p>

			<p>Savvy, smart, funny. Probably. I have nice friends.</p>

			<p><strong>What's your ideal Saturday night?</strong></p>

			<p>Going out with friends for dinner. Staying at home. Calling someone close.</p>

			<p><strong>What was your first ever job?</strong></p>

			<p>Product manager for Apple in California.</p>

			<p><strong>Would you consider your values more traditional or progressive?</strong></p>

			<p>My values are family, strong work ethic, integrity. I don't know or care what people might label them.</p>

			<p><strong>What are your favorite books?</strong></p>

			<p><em>Outwitting the Devil</em> opened my eyes to a lot of things when I read it in my late teens. <em>The Magic of Thinking Big</em> taught me to aim high. <em>The Dictator's Handbook</em> taught me about politics and power. <em>Flow</em> taught me about love and happiness.</p>

			<p><strong>Do you have social media?</strong></p>

			<p>I don't use social media. I have a LinkedIn that I check occasionally.</p>
